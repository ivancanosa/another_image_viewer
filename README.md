# another_image_viewer
An image viewer implementation using C++17 and SDL2

# TODO:
	* set/unset bilinear interpolation as command line argument
	* New view mode: Continuous. It renders all images in a vertical or horizontal line, contiguous to each other.
	* On quit, save current image name to a cache. Then, one next start up, start from that image position.
	* Change "cacheFilenames.hpp" so it also works on windows
